## Description:

This project is to take the frontend of a webpage and create the backend using express.js. Every note created should be appended to the database. In this case the database is a JSON db. The backend responds to saving a file and appends that file to the list of notes. The notes on the list should once clicked should then occupy the create note space showing the contents of each note retrieved from the db.
